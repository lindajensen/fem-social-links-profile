## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I've learned a bit more about buttons I think. And links. But IÃ¤m still not quite sure when to use which. I also learned a bit more about padding and margin which was needed.

```html
.btn {
    background-color: var(--grey);
    cursor: pointer;
    padding: 15px 20px;
    margin: 15px;
    border: none;
    border-radius: 10px;
    font-weight: 700;
    width: 250px;
}
```

### Continued development

It feels like I'm starting to get the hang of the difference between padding and margin which is nice, but it's definitely something I need to continue practicing and learn more about. I also need to learn more about Flexbox and just keep practicing. I also need to look into the difference between a button and a link and when to use which. 

### Useful resources

- [Mozilla Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/button) - This helped me a bit when it comes to the button element, which I decided not to use for the links. I went with anchor tags instead.
